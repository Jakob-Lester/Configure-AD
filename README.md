Cloud-Based Domain Infrastructure Deployment with Azure

In this project, I am designing and implementing a cloud-based Windows domain environment using Microsoft Azure. The objective is to set up a scalable and secure infrastructure that mirrors enterprise IT environments, leveraging key Microsoft technologies such as Active Directory, Remote Desktop, and PowerShell for efficient system management.

The core of this setup consists of two Azure-based virtual machines:

  Domain Controller & DNS Server – This VM will handle authentication, domain services, and name resolution.
  Client Workstation – A domain-joined computer for testing user authentication, permissions, and network policies.

Once the infrastructure is in place, I will configure Active Directory users, groups, and organizational units, applying tailored permission structures to simulate real-world access control. Additionally, I will implement file sharing policies and privilege management, ensuring proper role-based access while maintaining security best practices.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with cloud-based networking, system administration, and identity management, reinforcing key concepts in enterprise IT environments while utilizing industry-standard tools and best practices.
